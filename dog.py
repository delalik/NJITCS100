# Important Remark: When you modify the file dog.py the changes will not be reflected in the shell, even if
# you execute import dog again. Therefore, always start a new shell after modifying the class Dog.

'''
Problem 1
Write a class definition line and a one line docstring for the class Dog.
Write an __init__ method for the class Dog that gives each dog its own name and breed.
Test this on a successful creation of a Dog object.
>> import dog
>> sugar = dog.Dog('Sugar', 'border collie')
>> sugar.name
'Sugar'
>> sugar.breed
'border collie'
'''
'''
Problem 2
Add a data attribute tricks of type list to each Dog instance and initialize it in __init__ to the empty list. 
The user does not have to supply a list of tricks when constructing a Dog instance. 
Make sure that you test this successfully.
>>> sugar.tricks
[]

Problem 3
Write a method teach as part of the class Dog. The method teach should add a passed string parameter to
tricks and print a message that the dog knows the trick.
>>> sugar.teach('frisbee')
Sugar knows frisbee

Problem 4
Write a method knows as part of the class Dog. The method knows should check whether a passed string
parameter is in the dogâ€™s list of tricks, print an appropriate message and return True or False.
>>> sugar.knows('frisbee')
Yes, Sugar knows frisbee
True
>>> sugar.knows('arithmetic')
No, Sugar doesn't know arithmetic
False

Problem 5
Create a class attribute species of type str to be shared by all instances of the class Dog and set its value to
'canis familiaris'. The class attribute
    species should be defined within the class
    Dog but outside of any
method.
>>> dog.Dog.species
'Canis familiaris'
>>> sugar.species
'Canis familiaris'
'''
class Dog:
    'Represents a dog with attributes that will describe its name and breed.'
    def __init__(self, name, breed, tricks=[], species ="canis familiaris"):
        if tricks is None:
            tricks = []
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.tricks = tricks
        self.species = species
    def teach(self, newSkill):
        self.tricks.append(newSkill)
        return self.name + " knows " + newSkill
    def knows(self, checkSkill):
        if(checkSkill in self.tricks):
            print(self.name + " knows " + checkSkill)
            return True
        else:
            print(self.name + " does not know " + checkSkill)
            return False
