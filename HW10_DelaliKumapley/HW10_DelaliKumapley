Do all of the items below and submit one ZIP file containing all the solutions via Canvas. If you run into a
problem, post to Canvas describing where you ran into trouble or email your instructor or classroom
assistant, or ask your question during recitation hours. If you know the answer to someone’s question on
Canvas, post a response. You get course credit for asking and answering questions in Canvas.
• Read Chapter 11 (Dictionaries) in the textbook.
• Read the Python tutorial section 5.5 (Dictionaries). The Python tutorial can be accessed through the
documentation installed with IDLE:
    Help  Python Docs  Tutorial  5.5. Dictionaries
If you are using an alternate IDE, visit:
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
to browse the tutorial online.
• In the Python editor IDLE, create and save a Python file for each problem given. Before submitting
your solutions via Canvas, ZIP the Python files and name the archive, if your name is Harry Houdini,
for example,
    HW10_HarryHoudini.zip. Each Python file must begin with a comment containing your
name, class and section, the posting date and number of the homework assignment.
• Write and test. For each problem, write code that satisfies the problem specification. Test your code
by designing at least three inputs for each problem that you believe are likely to reveal any bug and
run your code on those inputs. Include the test inputs in the corresponding .py file.
